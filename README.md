This end-to-end data engineering project is build within Azure using Azure Data Factory, Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics, with visualization done in Power BI. The raw data is first stored in on-premise SQL server database and moved into Azure Data lake Gen 2 for storage and ingested in ADF. The ingested data is sent to Azure Databricks and goes through three layers of transformation (bronze, silver and gold), and then further transformation in Azure Synapse, at which point the data is ready for business-level analysis. The final visualization is completed in Power BI for business insights.
